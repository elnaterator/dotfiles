# Machine-specific Skills Configuration Override
# Copy this file to config.local.toml to override skill settings on this machine
# config.local.toml is gitignored and stays on each machine

# Example: Disable git-helper on this machine only
# [git-helper]
# enabled = false

# Machine-specific overrides take precedence over config.toml

# External Skills Paths
# Add paths to skill directories outside this dotfiles repo
# These will be symlinked to ~/.claude/skills/ alongside repo skills
# Paths can be absolute or use ~ for home directory
[external_skills]
paths = [
  # "~/projects/my-custom-skills/work-helper",
  # "/opt/shared-skills/deploy-assistant",
]
