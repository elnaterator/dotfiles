# Machine-specific Agents Configuration Override
# Copy this file to config.local.toml to override agent settings on this machine
# config.local.toml is gitignored and stays on each machine

# Example: Disable code-reviewer on this machine only
# [code-reviewer]
# enabled = false

# Machine-specific overrides take precedence over config.toml

# External Agents Paths
# Add paths to agent files outside this dotfiles repo
# These will be symlinked to ~/.claude/agents/ alongside repo agents
# Paths can be absolute or use ~ for home directory
# Agents should be .md files
[external_agents]
paths = [
  # "~/projects/my-custom-agents/deployment-expert.md",
  # "/opt/shared-agents/security-auditor.md",
]
